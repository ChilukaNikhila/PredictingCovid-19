# Predicting Covid-19 Infection
<div align="justify"> 
Since 2019, we have been experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. The cause of this pandemic has had a significant impact on the lives of citizens as well as the global economy. One of the most important tasks in this pandemic has been determining whether a person is infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2). To accomplish this, a dataset that records all possible symptoms, physiological parameters, and geographic parameters to predict infections is used. The primary goal is to identify the best model for predicting COVID-19 infection in a person.</div>

# Dataset description
<div align="justify"> The dataset used in the project is a COVID-19 symptom dataset.(HUNGUND, 2019) It is a dataset used to detect the infection of COVID-19 in an individual. The dataset was created based on WHO guidelines and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India. (WHO, 2019)(MoHFW, 2019).
The shape of the dataset is 316799x27. The dataset consists of 316799 records and 27 features,out of which 23 describe the symptoms, age, gender, contact, and country. The remaining four features describe the severity of the infection.</div>
