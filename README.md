# PredictingCovid-19
Since 2019, we have been experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. The cause of this pandemic has had a significant impact on the lives of citizens as well as the global economy. One of the most important tasks in this pandemic has been determining whether a person is infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2). To accomplish this, a dataset that records all possible symptoms, physiological, and Geographical parameters to predict infections are used. The primary goal is to identify the best model for predicting COVID-19 infection in a person.
# Dataset description
